web application storybooks

This app uses a Google OAuth 2.0 strategy for authentication. Users can login and create stories which can be set to public or private. They can also choose if comments are allowed to be posted. We will create a dashboard for users to manage their stories. We will create helpers for authentication and access control as well as handlebars template helpers.
